The file this goes into must be titled demo-config.json.
Options available:

To specify what files you want to show in the editor frame, add them
to the "files" object as seen below. Leave the object empty (but do not delete it)
if you are not using the editor frame. The "show" array specifies what lines
to show from that file. For example - "show": [2,15] will only show lines 2 through 15.
The "highlight" array similarly specifies which lines from that file to highlight.
Unlike "show", "highlight" can be a series of ranges instead of one range, so you can have
"highlight": [2,[4,10],12] which will highlight lines 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12.

For the Metadata object, you must specify the "title" with a string. This is the title that
will be used everywhere for your demo in place of the demo's folder name. If you want to
include a discussion forum for your demo, create one over on https://forum.introweb.tech and
add the link in "forum", otherwise delete that property.

For the Settings object, "module" will always be false (for now). The "frames" array
specifies which frames you need for your demo. The allowed combinations are (and the frame
order DOES matter):

["markdown"]
["editor"]
["editor", "view"]
["markdown", "editor"]
["markdown", "media"]
["markdown", "editor", "view"]
