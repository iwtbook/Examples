The file this goes into must be titled dir-config.json.

The "name" property is the title that will be used for this folder
everywhere in place of its folder name. The "order" array determines
the order of all of the demos in this folder.

You must have either nothing in the "order" array or every demo in
this folder.

You must use the actual folder names for the "order" array not the
names you specified in the config files

{
  "name": "HTML",
  "order": [
    "html-vs-xhtml",
    "core-HTML5",
    "proper-vs-convention",
    "urls"
  ]
}
