# The Box Model

## What is the box model?

The box model is a box consisting of 3 layers that wraps around the
**content** of every HTML element. The three layers are
(starting at the inner-most layer): **padding**, **border**, and **margin**. A good way to conceptualize this is to think about a painting on a wall.
