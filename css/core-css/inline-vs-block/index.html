        <p class="question">What is a block level element?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Block level elements have two main characteristics: They (by default)
          will fill up the entire width of their container, and they will insert
          a return, causing the following element to be displayed on the next
          line.
        </p>
        <p class="question">What is an inline level element?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Inline level elements are almost the opposite of block level elements.
          They take up just as much width as their contents need, and they do
          not cause anything to return to a new line.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Additionally, they ignore four CSS rules: width, height, margin-top,
          and margin-bottom (even if included in a shorthand margin rule).
        </p>
        <p class="question">There's inline-block??</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Inline-block level elements are the same as inline elements, except
          they notably allow you to modify the width, height, and all four
          margins.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          There are
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/">at least a dozen</a>
          other display types as well that we'll get to in other demos.

          This paragraph has <em>a lot</em> of inline
          <span class="elem">elements</span>. As you can see,
          <strong>these</strong> elements don't break the flow of the paragraph.

          The time of me writing this demo is
          <time datetime="13:35">1:35pm</time>. I have used some resources when
          making it, most notably the
          <cite
            ><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>'s CSS
            Specification</cite
          >.
