  <p>Yes it is another boring example. In this case we would like you review <a href="#fig1">Figure Ex-1</a></p>
  <p>More and more text is found until eventually the figure is located.</p>
  <figure id="fig1">
    <img src="figure.png" height="100" width="100" alt="A screen capture of the figure element in action" />
    <figcaption>
      <p>This mighty &lt;figure&gt; tag has returned from HTML 3 to haunt your dreams.
        <br />Figure Ex-1
      </p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Maybe some more content here.</p>
