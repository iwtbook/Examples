        <p>
          <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> is an empty element, which is why it's
          written often as a self-closing tag using XHTML synax.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, a lot of people used <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> elements to
          create spacing between elements or new paragraphs within a paragraph
          tag
          <br />
          <br />
          like this. These use cases have fallen out of favor for more semantic
          uses, such as creating new lines in poetry or formatting an address.

          <h2><code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code> is an empty element as well, so it is
          written with the self closing style.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code> element formerly stood for "Horizontal
          Rule", but in an effort to give it a more semantic meaning and less
          visual, it has since been renamed to the "Thematic Break" element.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          As you can see above, it usually renders as a thin horizontal line by
          default.
