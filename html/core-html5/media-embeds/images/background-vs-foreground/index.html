          Visually they both render the same, but they are used for two
          completely different purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Background images are implemented with CSS, and as such serve purely
          aesthetic purposes. Functionally they could be removed without
          affecting the content on the page as they are decorative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreground images on the other hand are implemented with HTML using
          your typical multimedia elements. They represent content, and without
          them the page would lose some of its meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you might see developers abusing background images with
          products on web shops as most browsers don't allow you to easily save
          background images by right clicking, but this is bad practice.
