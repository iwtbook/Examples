    <p>
      This is the first paragraph in the example about the
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. There really isn't much to say here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags are block elements by default, meaning that
      they will try to fill the width of their containers completely, leaving
      elements that come after them on new lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Semantically, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags represent a single paragraph, so
      if you find yourself using <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> elements to create
      paragraph breaks, you should probably use multiple
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.
