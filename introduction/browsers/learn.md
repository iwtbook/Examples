# How do Browsers Work?

Before we dive into the code, we first must have a basic understanding of our environment.

Browsers have two main functions (that we're concerned with):
1. Send and Receive data over HTTP
2. Construct interactive webpages from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any accompanying assets (images, fonts, etc.)

No matter what framework or library or tool is being used, it always boils down to plain HTML, CSS, and JS before the browser
parses it.
