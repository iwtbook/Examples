# Command Palette

The command palette lets you easily change any of your DevTools settings from
any place inside your DevTools. It also lets you navigate around to any panel or
line of code with ease.

## Opening the Command Palette

To open the command palette in the Chrome DevTools on mac you use the key
combo <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, and on Windows you use
the key combo <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.

## Disabling JavaScript

To disable JavaScript simply type `disable javascript` and hit enter to select
the first result.

{{disable-js}}

Similarly, to enable javascript type `enable javascript` and select the first
result.

{{enable-js}}

## Changing Other Settings

What we're really doing when we disable / enable JavaScript is toggling a checkbox
in the DevTools settings. Any of the DevTools settings can be modified directly
from the command palette in a similar fashion.
