# Elements - CSS

## Viewing CSS

By default, the CSS is usually next to the markup in the `Elements` tab. When you
select and HTML element, the CSS corresponding to it should appear in the CSS panel, as seen below.

{{html-and-css}}

## Editing CSS

To add a new CSS property or edit existing properties, click on or near an existing
property as shown here.

{{editing-rules}}

## Adding New Selectors

To add an entirely new selector instead of adding to an existing one, use the `+` icon.

{{new-selector}}

## Forcing Pseudo-States

To force a pseudo-state on an element, such as the `:hover` state, use the `:hov` menu to select the state you would like.

{{forcing-states}}

## Adding Classes to Elements

To add classes to selected elements from the CSS panel, use the `.cls` menu

{{adding-classes}}

## Emulating Mobile Devices

To emulate the size of mobile devices, select the phone / tablet icon near the element selection icon. NOTE: This only mimics the size of certain devices, this does not emulate the hardware or browser support of those devices, so it is not a replacement for QA on actual devices.

## Element Breakpoints

We will discuss breakpoints later at length, but for now just know that you can pause the execution of code when certain actions (attributes are modified, elements are deleted, etc) happen to elements you specify.
