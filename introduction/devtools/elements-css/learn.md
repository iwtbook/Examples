# Elements - CSS

## Viewing CSS

By default, the CSS is usually next to the markup in the `Elements` tab. When you
select and HTML element, the CSS corresponding to it should appear in the CSS panel, as seen below.

{{html-and-css}}

## Editing CSS

To add a new CSS property or edit existing properties, click on or near an existing
property as shown here.

{{editing-rules}}

## Adding New Selectors

To add an entirely new selector instead of adding to an existing one, use the `+` icon.

{{new-selector}}

## Forcing Pseudo-States

To force a pseudo-state on an element, such as the `:hover` state, use the `:hov` menu to select the state you would like.
