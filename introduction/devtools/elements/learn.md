# Elements

First we need to open our developer tools panel, you can do so a few ways (in most browsers).

- Pressing `F12`
- Pressing `CTRL` (or `CMD`) + `SHIFT` + `I`
- Right clicking and selecting `Inspect`

Once we have that open, we will first be looking at the `Elements` tab (in Firefox this is called
the `Inspector` tab), so along the top or the side of your panel find the correct tab and select it.

## Viewing & Editing HTML

By default the elements in the Elements panel will be mostly collapsed, but you can easily toggle them
open by clicking the small triangles next to each element

{{opening-closing-elements}}

Editing the text inside each element is pretty straight forward as well, you can usually double click
the inner text or right-click and select "Edit Text"

{{editing-text}}
