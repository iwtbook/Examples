# Elements

First we need to open our developer tools panel, you can do so a few ways (in most browsers).

- Pressing `F12`
- Pressing `CTRL` (or `CMD`) + `SHIFT` + `I`
- Right clicking and selecting `Inspect`

Once we have that open, we will first be looking at the `Elements` tab (in Firefox this is called
the `Inspector` tab), so along the top or the side of your panel find the correct tab and select it.

## Viewing the HTML

By default the elements in the Elements panel will be mostly collapsed, but you can easily toggle them
open by clicking the small triangles next to each element

## Editing the Text Content of an Element

Editing the text inside each element is pretty straight forward as well, you can usually double click
the inner text or right-click and select "Edit Text"

## Editing the Attributes of an Element

Editing the attributes of an element is similar to editing the text content. Simply right clicking on
an element and then selecting "Edit HTML" lets you edit the entire element.

## Deleting an Element

You can also remove elements entirely by right clicking them and selecting "Delete Element".
