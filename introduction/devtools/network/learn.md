# Network

The network tab is one of the most useful aspects of the developer tools. Any and all network requests that are made on your webpage will appear in this network tab.

## At A Glance

Just looking at the network tab on the [democompany.com](https://democompany.com) webpage, we see some checkbox toggles up top (Preserve log, Disable cache, etc), some filtering options just below (Fetch/XHR, JS, CSS, etc), a waterfall chart, and a table of some sort below listing every single resource that was requested.

## Selecting a Resource

When we select a resource, you'll notice that a sidebar pops up showing a lot of information about that request. There are three main sections to each request: The `General` section which shows the HTTP request / response line data, a `Response Headers` section, and a `Request Headers` section.

The general section of each request first shows some data that comes from each of the HTTP request and response lines.
