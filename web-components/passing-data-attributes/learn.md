# Passing Data - Attributes

Often times when making Web Components we want to allow developers to pass data into the our Web Component so they might be able to change some settings or style it a little bit.

There are three ways this is commonly done:

```html
<!-- Through attributes -->
<my-component fav-color="red"></my-component>

<!-- Through tags -->
<my-component>
  <fav-color>red</fav-color>
</my-component>

<!-- Through tags using <template> & <slot> -->
<my-component>
  <span slot="fav-color">red</span>
</my-component>
```

For this demo we are exploring the use of attributes to pass data.

## Lifecycle Callbacks

If you recall back to the lifecycle callback methods each web component has - you'll remember one titled `attributeChangedCallback()`. This method runs every time a *specified* attribute has been modified. This is the key method we'll be using to implement an attribute centered Web Component.

Our Web Component in this demo has 4 methods:

1. `constructor()`
    - Runs first
    - Simply calls `super()` and attaches a Shadow DOM
2. `static get observedAttributes()`
    - Called by the browser automatically right after the `constructor()`
    - Specifies which attributes we want to monitor
3. `attributeChangedCallback()`
    - Runs every time a specified attribute is modified
    - Saves the attribute information to the internal Web Component object using the `this` keyword (for easy access later)
4. `connectedCallback()`
    - Runs last and only when the element is inserted into a DOM
    - Accesses the attribute values saved to the internal Web Component object using the `this` keyword and attaches the markup and styles to the Shadow DOM root.
